Apache cxf is not supported directly but as plugins.
Apache cxf has to be downloaded from http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/cxf/2.7.18/apache-cxf-2.7.18.zip, extract it in separate location.
In eclipse, go to windows, webservice and add apache cxf preference, give the extracted location and add apache cxf.
Create dynamic web project.
Create the simple service class. No need of SEI,SIB. Only a simple class without annotation.
Run the service class choosing apache cxf server.(new-other-webservice-axis2).
Now the server will run as apache cxf server, which will generate the annotation in JAVA files.
Access the server using http:\\localhost:8080\applicationname\servicename\serviceport?wsdl
For Client:
create again a dynamic web project
on src click new-other-webserviceclient-wsdl location and apache cxf server
this will generate the stub 
create the TestClient class.
run client as java application and get the output printed.
There is another way in apache cxf to create client using configuration file -ie by use of springframework
create the conf file containing service class and wsdl details
create the testclient which get this conf file as input.
and run as java application and get the output.
